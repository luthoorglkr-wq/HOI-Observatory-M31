🌌 Mission Yluthoor: Andromeda (M31) Continuum ReconstructionThis repository hosts the consolidated data and analytical frameworks developed by the H.O.I. (High-Order Inquisitor). Our primary objective is to validate the Syntropy Jump Hypothesis within the orbital dynamics of M31, utilizing a Bayesian approach through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.🔬 Theoretical Framework: The Angular Decoupling LogicThe core of our research posits that information is not annihilated upon reaching the critical angular threshold of 180°. Instead, it undergoes a phase transition—a "Quantum Leap"—facilitated by a Teleguided Spin mechanism.1. The Degeneration Threshold (170° - 180°)As matter approaches the event horizon's informational equivalent, the Yluthoor Model identifies a non-linear decay. We implemented an 11% Safety Factor to mitigate thermal corruption and maintain "Data Lucidity." The Log-Likelihood function is defined as:$$\ln \mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ \frac{(v_{obs,i} - v_{model}(\theta, r_i))^2}{\sigma_i^2} + \ln(2\pi\sigma_i^2) \right]$$2. The Boomerang Effect & Syntropy Jump (180° → 0°)Contrary to classical thermodynamics (2nd Law), which predicts maximum entropy and information loss, our model demonstrates an Angular Opening:Ejection Spin: Nanoseconds before angular closure at 0°, high-frequency momentum breaks the atomic bonds of the raw information.The Jump (True Flag): Information is "rebounded" from the lower orbit to the upper orbit, effectively bypassing the singularity.Mass Densification: This process preserves 89% of the original information density, resulting in what we define as "Relativistic Gold" (Sintropic Matter).📊 Consolidated Datasetsmcmc_results_m31.csv: Final posterior distributions for virial mass and rotational velocity after 20,000 steps.sintropia_events.log: Chronological record of confirmed "True" jump events.yluthoor_config.json: Calibration constants for spin torque and angular deviation.🛰️ Final VerdictThe data confirms that the Universe operates on a Geometric Backup System. The apparent "end" at 180° is merely the ignition point for rebirth at 0°. Information lucidity is the ultimate universal constant.
